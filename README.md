## 👩‍💻 About Me

Hello! I'm **Dixie Laput**, a web developer based in London, ON I’ve always been amazed by technology and design, and I turned that passion into a career in web development. My journey started with a love for problem-solving and the drive to create beautiful, user-friendly websites that make a real impact. Over time, I've honed my skills in both front-end and back-end technologies.

I specialize in crafting intuitive, responsive, and visually appealing web applications. My focus is on building projects that not only look good but are also performant and accessible for everyone. From building dynamic user interfaces with **JavaScript**. I enjoy every part of the development process. 

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring new design trends, experimenting with UI/UX concepts, 3D printing, tinkering with arduino projects(servo motor) or learning about the latest technologies in the web development space. I’m always excited to learn new tools and techniques that can improve both my workflow and the experience I deliver to users.


**Skills & Technologies**:
- **HTML5** & **CSS3** (including Flexbox, Grid)
- **JavaScript** (Vanilla JS, ES6+)
- **React.js** (for building dynamic user interfaces)
- **GitHub** (Collaboration)
- **Database Management** (MySQL)
- **Responsive Web Design** (Mobile-first approach)
- **UI/UX Design** (Figma, Adobe XD, Sketch)

I believe that good design and clean code go hand in hand, and I strive to ensure that both aspects are optimized in every project I work on.
